// Java
public boolean isEmpty(String s) {
  return s.length() == 0;
}

# ruby
def empty?(s)
  return s.size == 0
end

One of the advantages of ruby is shown in the above example. This is called duck-typing. The Java code expects s to always be a string. However, the s in ruby code can be an array of objects or a string.
