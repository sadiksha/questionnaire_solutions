// Java
public boolean isEmpty(String s) {
  return s.length() == 0;
}

# ruby
def empty?(s)
  return s.size == 0
end

According to the above example, in the Java isEmpty method, the argument 's' should always be string. This is because s is strictly typed for Java and any other argument than string will raise an exception.

However, when s = [] || {} || "" the empty?(s) would return true. The empty?(1) will still not raise an exception, even though the value will be false because 1.size = 8. This behaviour is usually defined as duck typing.
